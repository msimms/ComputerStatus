    Home Computer Status is a combination of website and application (python script) for remotely monitoring the health of a computer. Currently, it can monitor CPU usage, memory usage, as well as GPU utilization and temperature (currently Nvidia GPUs only).
</p>
<p>
    To run it, get a copy of the python <a href="https://github.com/msimms/ComputerStatus/blob/master/client/monitor.py">client script</a> from <a href="github.com">github.com</a> and run it on the computer you wish to monitor (you'll also need to have python installed, of course).
</p>
<p>
    Since the client software is distributed as a python script, it will run on most commonly available operating systems. This includes Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
</p>
<p>
    The software is released under the MIT license, which is a very permissive license for open source software.
